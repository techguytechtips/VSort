# VSort

## About
VSort takes all files in a directory and sorts them based on file extension for easy organizing or better to organize afterwards.

## Usage
Just run VSort and it will Create a "Sorted" directory and copy all the files in the current working directory into a Sorted/(File extension) Folder.

## Options
Vsort has a help menu (`-h` or `--help`) and a option to force use a existing "Sorted" Directory instead of making one (`-f` or `--force`).
