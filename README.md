# VSort

## About
VSort takes all files in a directory and sorts them based on file extension for easy organizing or better to organize afterwards.

## Usage
Just run VSort and it will Create a "Sorted" directory and copy all the files in the current working directory into a Sorted/(File extension) Folder (or just to the root folder depending on the --no-dir option).

## Options
Vsort has a help menu (`--help`), a option to exclude hidden files from being sorted (`-h`) and a option to put all of the folders it makes in the current working directory instead of a "Sorted" folder (`-n`).

## Note
Linux only.

Windows support coming soon!
