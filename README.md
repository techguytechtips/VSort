# VSort

## About
VSort is the Swiss army knife of file organizing, allowing you to organize files with many options and features.
Including, organizing based on file extension, file type, and more coming soon!

## Usage
Just run `vsort -s` and (by default) it will create a "Sorted" directory and copy all the files in the current working directory into a Sorted/(File extension) Folder.

## Options
- Help menu (`--help`)
- Option to sort files based on file extension (`-s`)
- Option to use a advanced sorting algorithm instead of just sorting based on file extension, so .mp4, .mkv, etc goes into a video folder and so on (`-a`)
- Option to exclude hidden files from being sorted (`-h`)
- Option to put all of the folders it makes in the current working directory instead of a "Sorted" folder (`-n`)
- All options can be used in combination to do even more advanced sorting, as a example, you can use `-a` and `-s` together to sort files based on type then by file extension afterwards.
